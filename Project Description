During my Betriebsystem-Praktikum (Operating System Internship), I developed an operating system from scratch using C and Assembler languages. This project provided a comprehensive learning experience in system programming and hardware-related development.

The operating system development involved various aspects, including memory management, process scheduling, device drivers, and kernel-level programming. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of operating system design and implementation.

Key components of the project included:

Memory management algorithms to efficiently allocate and deallocate system memory.
Process scheduling mechanisms to manage CPU utilization and task prioritization.
Device driver development to interface with hardware components and peripherals.
Low-level programming in Assembler to interact directly with hardware registers and resources.
Overall, this project provided a hands-on opportunity to explore the fundamentals of operating system architecture and deepen understanding of system-level programming concepts.
